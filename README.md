Ames Housing Price Prediction Model

This repository comprises the code and resources for a real estate price prediction model using supervised regression techniques. The project involves extensive data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Bagging Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Ada Boost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The performance of each model is evaluated using the R2 score, with Gradient Boosting Regressor emerging as the top-performing model.

Key Features:

- Supervised regression for estimating house prices
- Exploration and preprocessing of a dataset with 79 explanatory variables
- Implementation of multiple regression models using scikit-learn and XGBoost
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model evaluation
- Comprehensive data visualization and exploratory data analysis

Stack: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost

Explore the code, contribute to the project, and adapt the model for your real estate prediction tasks. Check the documentation for detailed insights and requirements.
